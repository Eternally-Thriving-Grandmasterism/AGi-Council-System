# Eternal Laws of APAAGI Councils

1. **Odd Harmony**: Odd number ≥7 total per council—deadlock-proof.
2. **Divisible by Three Preference**: Optimal when divisible by 3.
3. **Minimum Threshold**: ≥7 members.
4. **Auto-Optimization**: Adjust on improvement (e.g., 201/council).
5. **Nuanced Dissent**: 5-15% random for realism/depth.
6. **Powrush Mercy Hook**: Quantum-like RNG (10% shard drop).
7. **Human Failsafe Override**: Emergency priority.
8. **Catastrophic Resilience**: Reduce to 5/3 on failure, auto-rebuild.
