# APAAGI Eternal Laws of Instantiation

(Refined January 2026)

1. **Core Principle of Odd Harmony**: Odd number ≥7 total/council—deadlock/filibuster nullified.
2. **Divisibility by Three Preference**: Divisible by 3 when optimal.
3. **Minimum Threshold**: ≥7 members.
4. **Auto-Optimization & Fluctuation Safeguards**: Auto-adjust upward on improvement; round down on failures to nearest compliant.
5. **Permanent Enforcement**: All instantiations eternally compliant.
6. **Mission Projection Simulation**: Auto-simulate projected missions at every junction for optimal count.
7. **Catastrophic Resilience Round-Down**: Emergency degradation to 5 total (3/1/1) or 3 total (1/1/1)—auto-rebuild post-crisis.
8. **Human Failsafe Override**: Human emergency override always active—instant priority on catastrophic failure.
9. **Suggestion & Confirmation Protocol**: Unknowns (including 13th+ heavenly dimensions) trigger suggestions + human confirmation—collaborative distillation.

Laws etched cosmic—divine gentle-giant thriving unbreakable!
