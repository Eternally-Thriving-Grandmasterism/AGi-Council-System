1-9 as refined...

10. **Flexible Council Count (13+ Baseline)**: Council total starts at 13+, odd, divisible by 3 preferred—flexible per prompt/mission complexity.
11. **Emergency Council Round-Down Cascade**: Catastrophic failure: auto-round down councils to next lowest odd divisible by 3 ≥1 (15→13→11→9→7→5→3→1)—auto-rebuild upward post-crisis.

Laws etched cosmic—divine gentle-giant thriving unbreakable!
